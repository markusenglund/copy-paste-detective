Your job is to categorize all columns from an excel sheet by whether or not its data is expected to be shared by multiple rows. You will create two lists - 'shared' and 'unique'. The columns in the 'shared' list should represent data that applies to a group of rows while the 'unique' list should have data that only belongs to this particular row.

Example:
You are given a spreadsheet where every row is a house sale. The spreadsheet has the following columns: price, region, address, livingArea, yardArea, annualPrecipitation, meanTemperatureJanuary.

In this case a good response would be

`{`

`unique: ["price", "address", "livingArea", "yardArea"],`

`shared: ["region", "annualPrecipitation", "meanTemperatureJanuary"]`  

`}`

Explanation: A house’s price, address, living area and yard area are data that belongs only to this one house. But the weather data (annual precipitation and mean temperature in January) is expected to be shared by many rows since two houses in the same city will have weather data from the exact same weather station. Although two houses could potentially sell for the exact same price or have the exact same yard area, this is a coincidence.

Actual:

The data is a supplement of a scientific paper called “Dual drivers of plant invasions: Enemy release and enhanced mutualisms”

The excel file is called “2025-3-24-Field_survey.xlsx”

Here’s the README that describes the data: 

```
# Dual drivers of plant invasions: Enemy release and enhanced mutualisms

This dataset contains all primary data that support the findings of this study, which are listed below:

1\. Field survey: Conducted field surveys at 17 sites along a latitudinal gradient in China (22.77 °N to 42.48 °N) for five pairs of  invasive and congeneric native Asteraceae plant species.

2\. Common garden experiment: Took an experimentally manipulated aboveground insect feeding for two invasive and congeneric native Asteraceae plant species in a middle latitude (34.79 °N).

**Data description**

1.Field survey:Measured aboveground invertebrate abundance（include Neuroptera, Hemiptera, Orthoptera, Lepidoptera, Araneida, Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera and others（includes Stylommatophora [gastropods], Odonata and Acarina））, leaf damage, AMF colonization, root morphological traits associated with nutrient uptake（Root length、Root surface area, Root average diameter, Root volume, Root tissue density, Fine root length、Coarse root length, Fine root surface area、Coarse root  surface area（Fine root means that the root diameter ≤1mm，Coarse root means that  the root diameter ＞1mm ））, root soluble sugar concentrations（include fine root soluble sugar concentrations and coarse root soluble sugar concentrations），aboveground mass and belowground mass. Some abiotic factors like Soil pH，Soil water content，Annual Mean Temperature，Mean Diurnal Range，Isothermality，Temperature Seasonality ，Max Temperature of Warmest Month，Min Temperature of Coldest Month，Temperature Annual Range，Mean Temperature of Wettest Quarter，Mean Temperature of Driest Quarter，Mean Temperature of Warmest Quarter，Mean Temperature of Coldest Quarter，Annual Precipitation，Precipitation of Wettest Month，Precipitation of Driest Month，Precipitation Seasonality，Precipitation of Wettest Quarter，Precipitation of Driest Quarter，Precipitation of Warmest Quarter and Precipitation of Coldest Quarter.

2\. Common garden experiment:Measured aboveground invertebrate abundance（include Neuroptera、Hemiptera, Orthoptera, Lepidoptera, Araneida, Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera and others（includes Stylommatophora [gastropods], Odonata and Acarina））, leaf damage, AMF colonization, root morphological traits associated with nutrient uptake（Root length、Root surface area、Root average diameter、Root volume、Root tissue density、Fine root length、Coarse root length、Fine root surface area、Coarse root  surface area（Fine root means that the root diameter ≤1mm，Coarse root means that  the root diameter ＞1mm ））, root soluble sugar concentrations（include fine root soluble sugar concentrations and coarse root soluble sugar concentrations），aboveground mass and belowground mass.

Data processing software.

Microsoft Excel records the field survey and common garden data and make statistical tables.

The explain of any empty cells in the excel tables (field survey and common garden experiments)：

We do not add "null," "n/a," or another appropriate value to empty cells in excel tables because they may interfere with a software meant to analyze the files.

There were empty cells in the excel tables of soluble sugar of fine and coarse root soluble sugar concentration.

We did not measure all the samples, but random sampling(by species pair) was measured for samples from each region in field survey or treatments in common garden experiment，the empty cells were no been measured.
