## Description of the data and file structure

### Files and variables

#### File: Dryad\_dataset.xlsx

**Description:** 

This dataset summarizes raw isotope data for rat tissues before and after digestion by Rhett, the red-tailed hawk, or Caspian, the eagle owl, who were individually housed at the Cincinnati zoo. We have also included isotope data for excreta produced by the birds. The study was conducted for a total of 11 days. A foot from each consumed rat was collected before feeding the birds, and then a regurgitated casting and excreta sample were collected from each bird's enclosure the following day. 

Within the dataset, blank cells indicate analyses that were not performed for specific samples. No data were excluded from the dataset.  

##### Variables

The dataset includes one spreadsheet with the following variables: 

* Rat bone collagen carbon (d13C), nitrogen (d15N) and oxygen (d18O) values both before and after digestion by the birds of prey. 
* Rat bone apatite d13C and d18O values, as well as strontium isotope ratios (87Sr/86Sr) both before and after digestion by the birds of prey. 
* Rat fur d13C and d15N values both before and after digestion by the birds of prey. 
* Rat muscle d13C and d15N values, only available for undigested rats. 
* d13C, d15N, and 87Sr/86Sr for  excreta produced by both birds. Data are provided for dried homogenized excreta, as well as excreta that were acidified with 0.5 N HCl for 5 hours. 
* Weight %C, %N, and both weight% and atomic C:N, as well as Sr concentration data. 

## Code/software

Data were analyzed using JMP Pro 16.0. There are no codes or software to report.
