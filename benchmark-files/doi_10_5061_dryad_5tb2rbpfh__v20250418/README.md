# Drought decreases carbon flux but not transport speed of newly fixed carbon from leaves to sinks in a giant bamboo forest

Dataset DOI: [10.5061/dryad.5tb2rbpfh](10.5061/dryad.5tb2rbpfh)

## Description of the data and file structure

In 2019, we conducted an experiment in China using stable carbon isotopes to track their movement in young bamboo plants and among their older, interconnected neighbors. The experiment was carried out under long-term dry conditions (a five-year drought) and normal conditions. We monitored the labeled carbon signals for a year, examining leaves, branches, roots, soil, and the carbon released from the soil.
