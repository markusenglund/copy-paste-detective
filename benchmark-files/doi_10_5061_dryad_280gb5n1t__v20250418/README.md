# Plant responses to light competition: Does evolutionary history matter?

Dataset DOI: [10.5061/dryad.280gb5n1t](10.5061/dryad.280gb5n1t)

## Description of the data and file structure

We performed a common-garden experiment where we measured varying shade avoidance and tolerance responses of the winter annual plant *Hymenocarpos circinnatus*, under five light-competition treatments that simulated different heights and densities of a surrounding vegetation. These responses were compared across plants originating from six populations along a climatic gradient, from a semi-arid to a mesic-Mediterranean region.

**Description:** 

##### Variables

* Plant ID: ID number of the pot and individual plant.
* Block: a random factor with the 10 experimental blocks, according to which the plants were arranged on the experimental benches, each containing the five treatment combinations and the six populations.
* Population: a random factor with the six populations of origin.
* Annual precipitation: a covariate that provides mean annual rainfall (mm)
* Neighbor height: a fixed factor with three treatments (control, short, or tall).
* Neighbor density: a fixed factor with three treatments (control, sparse, or dense).
* height:diameter ratio: a dependent variable, measured as the ratio between the height and diameter of *H. circinnatus.*
* Leaf angle: a dependent variable, visually estimated for the leaves of *H. circinnatus* and categorized as either 0, 45 or 90° relative to the horizontal plane (°).
* Branching intensity: a dependent variable, measured as as the number of active meristems (branches) relative to total meristem number per stem (branched nodes plus un-branched nodes) of *H. circinnatus.*
* Stem-base diameter: a dependent variable, measured as mean diameter of the two main stems of *H. circinnatus *(cm).
* Internode length: a dependent variable, measured as the ratio of stem length to the number of internodes of *H. circinnatus *(cm).
* SLA (specific leaf area): a dependent variable, measured as the ratio of leaf surface area to leaf dry mass of *H. circinnatus *(cm^2 / g).
* Leaf area: a dependent variable, measured as the  leaf surface area of *H. circinnatus *(cm^2).
* Amax (maximal photosynthetic rate): a dependent variable, estimated by fitting the carbon assimilation measurements for each *H. circinnatus* plant with light response curves using the Mitscherlich function (μmol / (s * m^2)).
* Aqe (apparent quantum efficiency): a dependent variable, estimated by fitting the carbon assimilation measurements for each *H. circinnatus* plant with light response curves using the Mitscherlich function.
* LCP (light compensation point): a dependent variable, estimated by fitting the carbon assimilation measurements for each *H. circinnatus* plant with light response curves using the Mitscherlich function (μmol / (s * m^2)).
* Shoot mass: a dependent variable, measured as shoot dry mass of *H. circinnatus* (g).
* inflorescence number: a dependent variable, measured as the number of *H. circinnatus*  inflorescences  at the time of harvest.
